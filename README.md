GUI for editing, saving, and loading LSTM / Recurrent neural networks
A program intended to help organize the construction of projects that require numerous neural networks. This is done by assigning each neural network to a 'Project' which saves all of the variables and file paths necessary to recreate it. This means that starting, stopping, saving, loading, and cloning your neural networks is much easier.

HOWEVER: this program was only intended to be ran on my setup for a very long time, and therefore may require a lot of work for it
to be ran on different setups.

My Setup:

* *A NVidia graphics card (GTX 1080 ti)*
* *An Intel CPU (8700k)*
* *tensorflow-gpu installed as the default version of tensorflow*
* *A Python3 environment named cpu_env placed in this project's directory (Not included from the github)*
* *This environment has the tensorflow version for CPU*
* *I use the GPU version to train the AI and the CPU version to generate samples while it's training*

* *Although the particular hardware should not effect whether or not this program runs, the brands and software setup
      will definitely effect how everything works*
